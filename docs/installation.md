Installation
============

[doc_toc]

Composer
--------

You can install this plugin into your CakePHP application using composer.

    "require": {
        "cakemanager/cakephp-posttypes":  "~1.0"
    }

Each time you run php composer.phar update you will receive the latest stable releases when using the default version constraint ~1.0. Only bugfix and minor version releases of 1.x will be used when updating.

If you want to keep current with the latest unreleased changes in the PostTypes Plugin you can add the change your applicationâ€™s composer.json:

    "require": {
        "cakemanager/cakephp-posttypes":  "dev-master"
    }

Be aware that is not recommended, as your application can break when next major version is being released. Additionally composer does not cache development branches, so it slows down consecutive composer installs/updates.


Configuration
-------------

You will need to add the following line to your application's `config/bootstrap.php` file:

        Plugin::load('PostTypes', ['bootstrap' => true, 'routes' => true]);

Now you are ready to add your PostTypes. Lets load the `PostTypesComponent` into your `AppController`:

        public function initialize()
        {
            // code

            $this->loadComponent('PostTypes.PostTypes');

            // code
        }
